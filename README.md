Rebel Operations Tracking System

Overview
This project, developed for ITEC 3200, is a comprehensive system designed to:
  - Track rebel operations, their locations, the personnel involved, and the resources used.
  - Ensure efficient organization, better planning, and optimized resource allocation.
    
Objective
The primary objective is to create a structured and efficient database system that organizes and tracks:
  - Rebel expertise, ranks, and assignments.
  - Ongoing and completed operations with objectives and outcomes.
  - Resources available at each location to ensure proper allocation.
    
Goals
The project aims to:
  - Organize detailed data about rebels, including their ranks and specialties.
  - Track mission objectives, progress, and outcomes for both ongoing and completed operations.
  - Monitor available resources at operational locations.
  - Establish clear links between operations, locations, and personnel for improved efficiency.
    
Solution
A structured database is created using MySQL Workbench to address the project goals. The database includes the following key components:
  - Rebels: Stores details about personnel, including roles and expertise.
  - Locations: Tracks operational locations and associated details.
  - Operations: Records mission objectives, progress, and outcomes.
  - Resources: Manages inventory needed for operations.

  - Personnel and the operations they participate in.
  - Operations and their respective locations.

Benefits
The system provides:
  - An easy-to-use interface for managing complex operational data.
  - Enhanced decision-making through organized information.
  - Efficient resource management and streamlined reporting.
  - Clear visualization of operational progress and resource distribution for successful mission planning and execution.

Project Components
The project consists of the following major deliverables:
  - Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD): Visual representation of database structure.
  - Table Implementation: Creation of tables to store information.
  - Queries: SQL queries for data retrieval and reporting.
    
Technology Stack
